# Sachs-Github
A repository created to display coding projects I have completed

Languages: Python, C++, MATLAB, Latex, Arduino C, Jack, Altium

## Table of Contents

1. Altium  
--> A prototype designed in Altium for acetone detection using a nanotechnology chemiresitive material. Essentially a glorified voltmeter with onboard processsing and data transmission capabilities.  
  
2. Nand_Games  
--> Games created in the Nand2Tetris Class. Created using Jack, a language built up from Nand gates. Can be run using the supplied VMEmulator given in the Nand2Tetris course.  
--> This includes games which are Pong-esque and deratives of Minesweeper  
  
3. Nano_Data_Processsing  
--> MEMS5801: Data Processsing for Cleanroom Data taken from a WashU Nanotechnology Course  
--> NDSU Project: Data Processing for the previously mentioned acetone detection project  
--> Code is not finalized and project is still in progress  
--> Written in Python  

4. Physics  
--> Gamma Ray Spectroscopy: Data Analysis for a Physics Lab taking the spectrum of a gamma ray source.  
--> Also calculations for gamma ray attenuation through a gold sheet  
--> Quantum Mechanics: Combination of Quantum-Mechanics based coding projects. Includes a finite difference method for the Woods-Saxon potential, and a VQE based method for chemical catalytic matrices  
  
  
5. Pygame_Games  
--> Games created in Pygame  
--> Games included: DinoGame, FlappyBird  
--> A project for fun to try and make some games using Python  

6. Technical Writing  
-->PDFs of Latex written technical reports in various topics in physics  
--> Topics include: Black Holes, Quantum Mechanics, Noise and Fourier Analysis, Phase Transitions, Fluid Mechanics  
  
6. VQE  
--> Indepdent Study Involving VQE  
--> Notes section with information on VQE  
--> AdvancedQCNotes is a presentation on VQE for an introduction to Quantum Computing class (in progress)  
--> Other folders are different code iterations of VQE using Qiskit  
--> DWave is a folder with code for VQE using DWave quantum annealer  
  
7. WashURacing  
--> Arduino C files written for WashU Racing  
--> Includes Sensorboard Code from 2 years of Car Model  
--> In progress Live Telemetry Model for offcar data transmission  
--> Data Analysis in both MATLAB and Python
--> Includes tests in Kalman Filtering
